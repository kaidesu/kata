# Kata Skeleton
Build a morning ritual of TDD code kata's. Use this skeleton as a base - PHPUnit, Gulp (for automated tests), and autoloading has been configured to be used right out of the box.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. `composer install`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp`
5. Code!

The gulp task will automatically watch every `.php` file for changes, and automatically fire off PHPUnit.
